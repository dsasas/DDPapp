This application presents the product of the course project for the **Developing Data Products** course, part of [**the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization** on **Coursera**] (http://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1).

This is the initial version of the application "Type and amount of the leading causes of death worldwide".

[R language] (http://www.r-project.org/) has become the most flexible language in the world of analytical programming, with top-level statistical, graphical, and analytical packages that are frequently updated and improved.

[The Shiny library] (http://shiny.rstudio.com/), developed by [RStudio] (http://www.rstudio.com/), allows R programmers to develop web applications entirely in R, without requiring any HTML, Javascript, or CSS (although those can all be used to extend features of apps).
