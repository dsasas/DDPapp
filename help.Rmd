## <a id="int"></a>1. Introduction


This application was built fo the **Developing Data Products** course, part of [**the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization** on **Coursera**] (http://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1). 

It has the purpose to provide an easy tool to that data on deaths and their causes in the world could be analyzed and compared across countries. It was planned the application would allow to predict the amount of deaths for years to come with a specific cause, but unfortunately it was not possible to implement this feature in the current version.

The application was built with R language [[3]](http://www.r-project.org/) using Shiny, an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web applications. Shiny is an RStudio project



## <a id="how"></a>2. How to use

The application is very simple. 

It has a navigation bar with three panels. The first one, **Analysis**, is the main panel, and it has the input tools and the output. The second one, **Documentation**, has a document with the following topics: Introduction, How to use, About the data, Limitations, Future enhancements and References. The least panel, **About**, has information about the current version. 

The inputs and outputs are in the main panel (**Analysis**). The following images shows the  navigation bar and part of the main panel.

### Inputs Tools

There are two input tools:

- **County** - It is a select box with the list of the countries. The user can choose one or more countries to compare data. It recommends choosing only two countries, at most so that the graphics do not contain much information. After selection, the user should click outside.

- **Cause** of the deaths - It is also a select box with the list of causes from [[2]](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd10cm.htm). The user can choose only one cause. After selection, the user should click outside.

The user should note that for some causes can be no or few deaths, depending on the chosen country. 

### Output

There are three outputs:

- **Graph** - After the user to select the countries and cause, the application plots the line graph with the data from from selected countries. Each country has a specific color line. 

- **Boxplot** - the application shows the box plot from each country. This way, the user can analyze, for example, means, quartiles and outliers.

- **Table** - the application also shows the respective table data below the graph.

The following image shows the  main panel.

## <a id="abt"></a>3. About the data

The source data, [[1]](http://www.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/mortality_rawdata/en/) and [[2]](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd10cm.htm), is on the public repository about health data.

It was necessary to perform some steps to clean and transform the data before use them. The steps are in the [Appendix](#apd).



## <a id="lim"></a>4. Limitations

Some limitations in the deployment of this application are:

- The source data do not have information for all causes and  years for some countries. Then, it was necessary to apply some filters to get the maximum of complete information. The application has only available the amount of deaths greater than 500. For this reason, there is not the complete list of causes and countries for input.

- The time limits defined to deploy the application.


## <a id="fut"></a>5. Future enhancements

The feature provides the following future enhancements:

- Add an input to provide prediction functionalities. 

- Improve steps for the data transformation and cleaning to get more causes and countries.

- Improve the layout of the panels.
